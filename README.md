# Using the DNS Lookup API web service

[DNS Lookup API](https://dns-lookup.whoisxmlapi.com/api) performs DNS queries
via simple HTTP requests  and returns results containing the IP address of the
primary domain (A record), DNS servers, mail servers (MX records) and more as
JSON/XML-encoded objects.

Here you'll find examples of querying the API implemented in multiple
languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://dns-lookup.whoisxmlapi.com/api/signup) to
authenticate.

This API also supports
[API key authentication](https://dns-lookup.whoisxmlapi.com/api/documentation/making-requests).

Please, refer to the
[DNS Lookup API User Guide](https://dns-lookup.whoisxmlapi.com/api/documentation/making-requests) for
info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
