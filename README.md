# Using the DNS Lookup API web service

[DNS Lookup API](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/dns-api.php) performs DNS queries
via simple HTTP requests  and returns results containing the IP address of the
primary domain (A record), DNS servers, mail servers (MX records) and more as
JSON/XML-encoded objects.

Here you'll find examples of using the API implemented in multiple languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/user/create.php) to
authenticate.

Please, refer to the
[DNS Lookup API User Guide](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/dns-api-guide.php) for
info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
